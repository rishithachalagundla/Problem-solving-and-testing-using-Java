Given a list of strings words and a string pattern, return a list of words[i] that match pattern. You may return the answer in any order.
A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters p so that after replacing every letter x in the pattern with p(x), we get the desired word.
Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter. 

Example 1:

Input: words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"], pattern = "abb"
Output: ["mee","aqq"]
Explanation: "mee" matches the pattern because there is a permutation {a -> m, b -> e, ...}. 
"ccc" does not match the pattern because {a -> c, b -> c, ...} is not a permutation, since a and b map to the same letter.
Example 2:

Input: words = ["a","b","c"], pattern = "a"
Output: ["a","b","c"]
 

Constraints:

1 <= pattern.length <= 20
1 <= words.length <= 50
words[i].length == pattern.length
pattern and words[i] are lowercase English letters.

code:

class Solution {
    public List<String> findAndReplacePattern(String[] words, String pattern) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String word : words) {
            if (matches(word, pattern)) {
                result.add(word);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
    private boolean matches(String word, String pattern) {
        Map<Character, Character> p2w = new HashMap<>();
        Map<Character, Character> w2p = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
            char p = pattern.charAt(i);
            char w = word.charAt(i);
            if (p2w.containsKey(p) && p2w.get(p) != w)
                return false;
            if (w2p.containsKey(w) && w2p.get(w) != p)
                return false;
            p2w.put(p, w);
            w2p.put(w, p);
        }
        return true;
    }
}
